## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#recoding Movie ID into Movie title 
#install.packages("dplyr")  # Install dplyr if you haven't already
library(dplyr)             # Load dplyr
data <- data %>%
  mutate(Movies.ID = recode(Movies.ID, 
                             `1` = "A quiet place", 
                             `2` = "Abigail", 
                             `3` = "Alien", 
                             `4` = "Beetlejuice", 
                             `5` = "The Crow", 
                         `6` = "The watchers"))

#removing 0 from Rating score 
   data$rating[data$rating == 0] <- NA 

# removing NA 
   
data <- data[complete.cases(data$rating), ]
   


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

# Load necessary packages
library(ggplot2)

# Corrected data frame with numerical ratings and descriptive labels
data <- data.frame(
  Movie = c("A Quiet Place", "Abigail", "Alien", "Beetlejuice", "The Crow"),
  rating = c(4, 3, 2, 5, 1)  # Use numerical values for ratings
)

# Map numerical ratings to descriptive labels
rating_labels <- c('1' = "Bad", '2' = "Alright", '3' = "Average", '4' = "Great", '5' = "Amazing")
data$rating_label <- factor(rating_labels[as.character(data$rating)], levels = rating_labels)

# Create a bar plot of ratings by movie
ggplot(data, aes(x = reorder(Movie, rating), y = rating, fill = rating_label)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +  # Flip coordinates for better readability
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Bad" = "red", "Alright" = "orange", "Average" = "yellow", "Great" = "lightgreen", "Amazing" = "green")) +
  labs(title = "Ratings by Movie",
       x = "Movie",
       y = "Rating",
       fill = "Rating Label") +
  theme_minimal()




```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
